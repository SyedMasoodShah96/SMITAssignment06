        <p> Dear Peter </p>

        <p> <b>Re: Sales Assistant Vacancy (Vacancy Number 40568)</b> </p>

        <p> I am writing to apply for the position of Sales Assistant at ABC Cloting Ltd, which was advertised on
            <br> Trade Me on 14th Feburary 2013. </p>

        <p> I have enclosed my CV to support my application. It shows that I would bring important skills to the
            <br> positon, including: </p>

        <p>  
            <ul>
                <li>time management and strong organisational skills</li>
                <li>high-level customer service and friendly relationship management</li>
                <li>cash handing and sales ability</li>
                <li>motivation and dedicaton</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p> As a Sales Assistant at a busy shoe store, I have been able to build up a strong foundation of customer
            <br> service skills. Though I have really enjoyed this role, I am looking for a new challenge in my career. The
            <br> Sales Assistant role with ABC Clothing Ltd would offer me a chane to grow and further develop my retail
            <br> career. </p>

        <p> I would enjoy having the opportunity to talk with you more about this position, and how I could use
            <br> my skills to benefit your organization at an interview. </p>

        <p> Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you. </p>
    
        <p> Yours sincerely </p>
